Meredith VO: So. I made it through my first shift. We all did. The other interns are all good people, you'd like them. I think. I don't know. (fade to Meredith running up stairs in the rain, under an umbrella) Maybe. I like them. (She enters a building, reception waves her on) Oh, and I changed my mind. (Close-up on an older woman). I'm not going to sell the house. I'm going to keep it. I'll have to get a couple of roommates, but (we see Meredith is talking to her) it's home, you know?
Older woman: Are you the doctor?
Meredith: No. I'm not your doctor. But I am a doctor.
Older woman: What's your name?
Meredith: It's me, mom. Meredith.
Ellis Grey: All right. (fidgets with her watch) I used to be a doctor, I think.
Meredith: (taking her hand) You were a doctor, mom. You were a surgeon.
(Slow zoom out and fade to black on the two.)
