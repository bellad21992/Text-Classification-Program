Dan So, think I've got a shot at a second date?
Sererna Well, I don't think we can top this one.
Dan I did punch someone.
Serena True, we talk about it in the cab.
[They get into the cab, Nate watches them leave, Blair and Chuck stand outside too]
Blair She better not show her face again.
Chuck I'm actually hoping she will.
[INT CAB - Dan hugs Jenny, then looks at Serena who smiles at him, Serena turns and looks out of the side window]
