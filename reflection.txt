The two source bodies of texts I chose were scripts from two of my favorite TV shows on Netflix. The first source body of text was the script from the first episode of season 1 of “Grey’s Anatomy”, a show about doctors. The second source body of text was the script from the first episode of season 1 of “Gossip Girl”, a show about a group of friends in high school. Of the four new bodies of texts I chose to compare against the sources, two of them were the ending scenes from each of these scripts. Another new body of text I chose was the script for the first episode of season 1 of “Private Practice” which is also a show about doctors, similar to “Grey’s Anatomy.” The final new body of text I chose was the script from the first episode of season 1 of “90210”, which is also a show about a group of friends in high school, like “Gossip Girl”.


The results of my comparison revealed that the ending scene from Grey’s Anatomy was more likely to have come from the script of Grey’s Anatomy rather than Gossip Girl, and that the ending scene from Gossip Girl was more likely to have come from the script of Gossip Girl rather than Grey’s Anatomy. Also, the script from Private Practice was more likely to have come from the script of Grey’s Anatomy, while the script from 90210 was more likely to have come from the script of Gossip Girl. Based on my results, I can conclude that my text classification program works since it is able to accurately compare TV shows of similar genres. I think that the program could be improved by adding more cases to the stem function to more accurately compare word stems within the bodies of text.
